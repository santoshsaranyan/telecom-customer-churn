# Telecom Customer Churn

Description
-----------
This project focuses on predicting if a customer of a telecom service provider is at a high risk of churn (switch telecom service providers), and identify the features that contribute to customer churn.

•	Applied the Random Forest machine learning model (and other models such as AdaBoost and Decision Tree) in Python on a Telecom churn case study Kaggle dataset to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

•	Reduced the number of features using feature selection (the RFE method) and took care of missing values with Simple Imputation (with median as the method). 

• Identified the key features that affected customer churn which were: minutes spent on local incoming calls, minutes spent on all incoming calls and recharge amounts. 

By knowing the key features, telecom companies can focus on these areas to improve their service and keep more customers.
